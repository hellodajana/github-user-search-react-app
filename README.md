![Design preview for the GitHub user search app coding challenge](./src/assets/preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution to the [GitHub user search app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes

### Continued development

- Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences, using Research prefers-color-scheme in CSS.
- If a GitHub user hasn't added their name, show their username where the name would be without the `@` symbol and again below with the `@` symbol.
- If a GitHub user's bio is empty, or any of the location, website, twitter, or company properties are location, website, twitter, or company properties are empty, show the text "This profile has no bio" / "Not Available" with transparency added.
- Website, twitter, and company information should all be links to those resaources. For the company link, it should remove the `@` symbol and link to the company page on GitHub. For Octocat, with `@github` being returned for the company, this would lead to a URL of `https://github.com/github`.
